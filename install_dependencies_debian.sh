# Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
#
# * bazel: to build Centipede.
#    You may need to do these steps first:
#    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install-ubuntu.html
# * libssl-dev: to link Centipede (it uses SHA1).
# * binutils: Centipede uses objdump.
# * clang: to build Centipede and the targets.
#   For most of the functionality clang 11 or newer will work.
#   To get all of the functionality you may need to install fresh clang from
#   source: https://llvm.org/.
#   The functionality currently requiring fresh clang from source:
#     * -fsanitize-coverage=trace-loads
#     (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html#tracing-data-flow)

# Add Bazel distribution URI as a package source
apt install -y curl gnupg apt-transport-https
curl -fsSL https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg \
  | gpg --dearmor > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/bazel.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
apt update

apt install -y bazel binutils libssl-dev

# Get clang-14, the oldest version that supports dataflow tracing
mkdir /clang
curl https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-clang/Linux_x64/clang-llvmorg-14-init-9436-g65120988-1.tgz -o /clang-14.tgz
tar zxvf /clang-14.tgz -C /clang

# * TODO(kcc): llvm-symbolizer is required for running Centipede.
#   it comes with clang, but may be called e.g. llvm-symbolizer-11
